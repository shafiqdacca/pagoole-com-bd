    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm <strong>Shafiqul Islam Tuhin</strong>, a dedicated software developer with a strong focus on delivering
      high-quality, efficient, and scalable solutions. I specialize in <strong>JavaScript, Oracle APEX, Oracle
        database management, and modern web development frameworks</strong>. Over the years, I have built numerous
      interactive web and mobile applications, ERP systems, and internal business solutions that have streamlined
      operations and improved efficiency for organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am passionate about crafting <strong>clean, maintainable, and scalable code</strong> following industry best
      practices. I continuously learn and adapt to emerging technologies to provide innovative solutions. I focus on
      identifying root causes of problems and ensuring that my solutions not only solve the immediate issues but also
      prevent future ones. Clear communication with stakeholders is crucial, and I ensure that technical solutions align
      perfectly with business objectives while delivering projects on time and within budget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond software development, I have a strong interest in <strong>ERP systems, audit reporting, and data-driven
        insights</strong>. I enjoy converting complex requirements into simple, usable applications and helping
      businesses
      make informed decisions through efficient digital tools.

    <h2>Industry Focus</h2>
    <p>
      I have extensive experience in <strong>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems</strong>, especially in the
      <strong>Ready-Made Garment (RMG) sector</strong>. I have worked on multiple projects that optimize processes
      from procurement and production to finance and reporting. Key highlights include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Designing and implementing ERP modules for RMG, integrating inventory management, order processing, financial
        tracking, and production workflows into unified systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Developing internal audit and reporting solutions to convert complex business data into actionable insights,
        enhancing operational transparency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure ERP systems meet evolving business needs while maintaining
        high performance and reliability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Automating repetitive business processes, optimizing workflows, and reducing manual errors to save time and
        operational costs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continuous learning and implementing new technologies in web and mobile development to create interactive and
        user-friendly solutions for both internal and client-facing applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      My goal is to bridge the gap between business needs and technical solutions, delivering systems that are reliable,
      scalable, and intuitive for users. Whether it’s building an ERP solution, a financial management tool, or a
      digital reporting platform, I focus on quality, efficiency, and long-term sustainability.
